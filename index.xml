      <description>After living my life in interesting times, I decided to switch careers and finally get into the field I&amp;rsquo;ve loved since I was in my early teens. I know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be slightly more difficult to break into a new field when I&amp;rsquo;m over 50, but I have so much to offer a company that&amp;rsquo;s willing to give me a chance. Because my life hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a straight path, I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up invaluable experience that helps me see the world through many different lenses.</description>

      <title>Paranormal Playlist</title>

      <description>About
This is a recommender system that lets you enter a paranormal romance book and get back a list of 20 hair metal songs as a soundtrack. I looked around for an app or website that would let a reader create a playlist based on a book, but there weren&amp;rsquo;t any. Every recommender I found stayed within the same mediums: book to book, music to music, etc. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have some fun and create my own.</description>

      <description>This project will incorporate pieces from several other repos dealing with book data to build a personal library.
About
I have a large personal library that includes books, ebooks, and audiobooks. For several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve used a free program called Calibre to manage my ebooks. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about including my audiobooks and physical books, as well, but I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to find the best way to include everything I want.</description>

      <title>Predicting the NBA MVP</title>

      <description>About
My grandson asked me about setting up a webpage or app with a dashboard for NCAA or NBA stats. I wanted to be able to show him how to scrape the stats and use it to make predictions before moving on to the dashboard, but I needed more practice myself before teaching him.
Data
For this project, I scraped data from basketball-reference since it had a table with MVP data that was easier to scrape.</description>
